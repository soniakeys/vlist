"Fast Functional Lists, Hash-Lists, Deques and Variable Length Arrays",
Phil Bagwell.

This is a simple example, originally written for Rosetta Code.  It could be built upon in various ways, for example:
- A copy function.
- Go-like slicing and appending.
- More Lisp-like functions.
- More efficient representation.  Probably with the unsafe package, ideas from the Bagwell paper could be implemented.
